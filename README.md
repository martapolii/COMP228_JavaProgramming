This repository is a work in progress for the Java Programming (COMP-228) course at Centennial College. 
So far, I have covered advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading. 
The course will further explore topics such as GUI development using JavaFX, database integration with JDBC, and multithreading.

Key Concepts 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Advanced features like inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading.
- Java Methods: Creating static and instance methods and method overloading.
- JavaFX: Developing GUI applications and handling events.
- JDBC: Connecting Java applications to databases.
- Multithreading: Implementing concurrency in Java applications.
- Java Collections: Using lists, sets, and maps to handle data efficiently.
